## Introduction

 we present **Faster And More Efficient Subject Image Generation for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models**, we introduce a new topic-customized method that requires no repeated training. It trains a plugand-play image prompt adapter with only 417M parameters, lightweight yet powerful, surpassing existing models in both text and image consistency.
